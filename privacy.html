			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h2>groveatspringbranchapartments.com</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>	
				Welcome to the groveatspringbranchapartments.com website (the “Site”), which is owned and operated by RentVision, LLC d/b/a RentVision (“RentVision” or “we” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. We have established this privacy policy and are providing it to you so that you can understand the manner in which we collect and use your information and the efforts we use to protect it. Please note that this policy is for this Site and does not apply to third party advertisers or third party websites linked from our Site. Nor does it apply to the RentVision.com website or the activities of RentVision in its own capacity. Please check the privacy policies on those websites for more information.

				The General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective on May 25, 2018, creates consistent data protection rules across Europe. It applies to all companies that process data about individuals in the European Union. The GDPR imposes responsibilities on “data controllers” and “data processors.” A company is a “data controller” when it has the responsibility of determining why and how personal data is processed. A company is a “data processor” when it processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. The GDPR imposes unique requirements on data controllers and data processors.

				RentVision has created this Site for the company associated with this Site, Grove at Spring Branch, LLC. As a result, Grove at Spring Branch, LLC acts as “data controller” for the Site and RentVision acts as “data processor” for the Site. In other words, Grove at Spring Branch, LLC determines what data is collected from the Site and for what purpose and RentVision merely processes and stores such data. RentVision relies on Grove at Spring Branch, LLC’s legal basis for data collection when processing data collected through the Site. Grove at Spring Branch, LLC’s legal basis arises from Grove at Spring Branch, LLC’s need to evaluate and process rental applicants, provide property management services, and to advance Grove at Spring Branch, LLC’s other legitimate interests, as described more fully in Section 2. Grove at Spring Branch, LLC also relies on your consent in some circumstances as the basis for processing your personal information.

				This Statement of Privacy is designed to address only RentVision’s data practices with respect to activities conducted via the Site. RentVision may occasionally partner with third parties, such as Google Analytics, in the course of processing data via the Site. RentVision is committed to ensuring that it has appropriate terms in place with such partners so that both RentVision and others comply with their respective requirements under the GDPR.
			</p>
			<h3>1. Personal Information Collected</h3>
			<p>
				The following types of personal information may be collected, stored, and used via the Site:

				Information about your computer, including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, and operating system;
				Information about your visits to and use of the Site, including the referral source, time of visit, length of visit, page views, and website navigation paths;
				Information that you enter when you register with or use the Site, including your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and phone number;
				Information relating to any rental applications you submit through the Site, such as your billing address, credit card number, social security number, date of birth, driver’s license number, and income;
				Information relating to any calls that you place via the Site, including when you placed the call, the length of the call, the participants on the call, and the content of the call (which may be recorded);
				Information relating to anything you purchase, services you use, or transactions you make through the Site;
				Any other personal information that you provide or send to us through the Site.
				Note that before you disclose to RentVision the personal information of another person, you must obtain that person’s consent to both the disclosure and the processing of that personal information in accordance with this Statement.

				RentVision may, from time to time, appoint third parties to collect the information referenced above so that the information may be used for one or more of the purposes described below. For example, RentVision may appoint Google Analytics to collect data regarding your use of the Site. In such cases, it is third party partners sole responsibility to comply with the GDPR.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
			<p>
				RentVision (and/or RentVision’s third party partners) may use your personal information to perform the following activities on behalf of Grove at Spring Branch, LLC:

				To operate the Site and to personalize the Site to you (see Section 3 for more information);
				To contact you (such as by mail or email) for the purpose of informing you of rental availabilities and/or products or services available from RentVision, Grove at Spring Branch, LLC, or their affiliates;
				To contact you (such as by mail or email) for the purpose of conducting market research, such as by requesting your opinion about current services or potential new services that may be offered;
				To provide you with customer support;

			</p>
			<h3>3. Use of Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				The Site may use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

				One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Site pages, or register with or provide information to the Site, a cookie helps RentVision to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Site page, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.
			</p>
			<h3>4. Third Party Advertising and Remarketing</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to using cookies and related technologies as described above, RentVision may also permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on the Site. These companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior. These companies may use information about user behavior in order to provide customized advertisements across various products and services. In the course of providing these products and services or placing advertisements, these third party companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on the Site and on third party websites. Each of these companies uses this cookie information according to its own privacy and security policies. Third party companies that RentVision may use for these purposes are Google, Facebook, and/or Bing. Users may opt out of use of cookies by visiting Google’s, Facebook’s, and/or Bing’s advertising opt-out page.
			</p>

				Personal information that RentVision processes or enlists others to process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes, and in no event shall such information be kept for more than a reasonable period of time. However, RentVision will retain personal information beyond this time period to the extent it is required to do so by law or to the extent reasonably necessary to defend Grove at Spring Branch, LLC’s rights or property.
